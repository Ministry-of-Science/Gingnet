Those are all the ones I know of. There may be others, I've missed.
If you have one to add, let me know, I'll check it out and add it.
No "Only rarely drops in custom sytles" please - if I can't confirm
it, I can't add it.

Crseshld 1 * is very hard to obtain, just cause dominerds are a
pain to S rank. I got lucky with a blackbomb 3, heatside, and
lifesword draw against 2 ratton2s and a dominerd. Expect difficulties
if you're after that one.

Shadow * is easiest to obtain when darkman can appear in Undernet 6.
An encounter with a shadow and some other weak virus appears, and you
can kill both in 1 shot with lifesword.

Poisonface's always seem to appear with totems 2s. Use copydamage on
the poisonface, and a high powered attack on the totem2 to s-rank them.

Lavaball is the easiest - quickly chuck a blackbomb 3 directly at it,
it will detonate and take out it and the 2 fishys that are always with
it. Unforunately, you usually get dash *, so keep at it.

Iceball is a pain too, primarily cause they appear in only pairs, so
you have to work darned fast for the S rank. I did this - equip a heatstyle
or floatshoes. Move forward 1 square, toss a blackbomb 3 L. Move up 1 square.
Wait till the bottom coldhead makes the about to open motion, then copydamage
on the top one, then a heatside L to detonate the blackbomb.

PosnMask - Use the Poisonface copydamage trick. Copydamage on the face, hit
the totem1 that's always there with something hard enough to kill them.

Mole 1/2 - Oh good lord, this one is sheer torture. Since you can't use
gutsman, you're very limited. I suppose you could hope to get lucky with
a gelrain PA. I personally got lucky with Bigwaves and Mine * - move to
the back row to use bigwave, so they won't jump behind you and dodge it.
Use mines, and hope. It's not pleasant.
