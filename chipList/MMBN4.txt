***IMPORTANT: If you don’t want to see minor spoilers, then it’s 
important that you do NOT read on. This FAQ might contain story 
elements, or other surprises that you might not want to read until you
see it in the game for yourself. Remember, you have been warned =P.

Wow, I never thought I would see myself making a FAQ, but damn here 
goes one now. Because this is my first ever FAQ, don’t expect to see 
something that can easily be compared to the work of complete MMBN 
experts. They’ve been writing for months on end. Even with this in 
mind, I tried my damned hardest, so I’m hoping the turnout is decent. 

I created this guide with the thought that it’ll help give reference 
to all the Battle Chips in the game. It’ll be much easier for the 
people viewing who already don’t know about many of the chips to 
create folders to their liking.

Anyways, with that aside, here is the important thing: The format that
will be used for the Chips Overview sections. Not very hard to 
understand:

(NOTE: The overview sections are ordered by the Number/Class System).

Chip Number and Name 
-Codes the Chip comes in.
-Damage the chip does.
-Number of hits the chip does.
-Chip type and MB.
-Description 
-Range (A TXT Map of the battlefield is given.)

It’s time for this FAQ to get started. Hope you enjoy.

Keyword: [CINFO]

Chips, as most of you SHOULD already know, are the most important 
things needed in a battle. They range from damaging the enemy, 
supporting yourself, and changing field conditions. When not inside 
battle, you place your Battle Chips inside a thing called a folder. 
Only 30 Chips can be placed in this folder, no more, no less. This 
system some what resembles that of a Card Game, were your Folder is 
your Deck, and Chips are the Cards you place in it. 

Here are the 3 important chip systems info that you should familiarize
yourself with.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

*NUMBER/CLASS: Each Chip fits into a number/class system. There are 5 
different classes of Chips: Standard, Mega, Giga, and the newly added
Secret and Dark Classes. A numbering system is given for each class 
as well, with the exception of Secret and Dark Chips. Here is a quick
overview on each class:

01. STANDARD CHIPS
The most used Chip class in any folder. Only four of a single Standard
Chip can be placed in your folder, even if their letter codes are 
different (I.E. You can only play 2 Cannons A and 2 Cannons B).

02. MEGA CHIPS
Only ONE copy of any Mega Chip is allowed per Folder (I.E. You can 
only play 1 Protoman B, and 1 MetalMan M). Also, only FIVE Mega Chips 
are allowed per Folder (unless you use a Navi Customizer Program). 
Mega Chips have somewhat of a sub category called Navi Chips. Navi 
Chips are basically chips that involve the use of in-game Navis you‘ve
meet. This is important to know because Navi+20 only works with these 
types of chips. Red Sun and Blue Moon both have their own set of 18 
additional Navi Chips, but they are NOT exclusive to that game. 

*Basically, if a Red Sun Navi Mega Chip is traded to a Blue Moon cart,
it will show up in your library as a Secret Chip. Also if you 
encounter a Navi on the internet that you obtained through trading 
Navi Soul Data with the opposite cart, and you obtain their chip, it 
will show up in your library as a Secret Chip as well.* 

03. GIGA CHIPS
Only ONE Giga Chip can be placed per Folder (unless you use a Navi 
Customizer Program). Red Sun and Blue Moon have their own set of Five
Giga Chips that CANNOT be traded to other games.

04. SECRET CHIPS
Most of these chips count as Standard Chips. With the exception of 
GUNSOLEX, Z-SAVER, GRANDPRIXPOWER, and DUO, these chips can be 
obtained by beating certain Navis in Higsby Free Tournament, and only 
once you’ve linked up with an opposing game cartridge to transfer Navi
Soul data. 

To obtain a higher level of any Chip, the opposing cartridge that you
linked with has to be in a harder mode of play (i.e. Hard Mode for 
level 2, Super Hard Mode for level 3). Collecting all these chips is 
not necessary because you don‘t need them to fully complete the game.

(NOTE: that Mega Chips exclusive to one version will show up as a 
Secret Chip in the opposing version.)

05. DARK CHIPS
These chips don’t go towards the Chip Library. They appear randomly 
when you’re Emotion window is in the Worried or Dark Megaman stat. Be
warned, as 1 hit point will be PERMANENTLY deducted from your maximum 
HP when you use a Dark Chip.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

*CODE: Each Chip has a corresponding letter code that goes along with
it. Chips only have up to 3 Codes, not including the * code. Some 
chips are only found in the * code, while some chips do not have the *
code at all. Chips come in the following codes:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z * 

Alphabet system of course. Note that Dark Chips have no code, and 
cannot be selected with any other chips except other Dark Chips.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------

*TYPE: Apart from the Class, and Code system, each Chip also fits into
one of 14 different types. Types are used as sacrifices for the new 
Double Soul function (excluding Normal and Dark). Also, Fire, Water, 
Wood, and Electricity carry on elemental attributes, and have 
strengths against enemies who carry an element. Fire burns Wood, Wood 
demolishes Electricity, Electricity zaps Water, and Water soaks Fire. 
Here is the list of types 

(NOTE: RS stands for Red Sun exclusive, while BM stands for Blue
Moon exclusive):

01. Normal
ICON: White Dot
These chips do not go towards any Double Soul effects. 

02. Fire
ICON: Flame 
These chips go for sacrifice for Fire Soul (RS). These do double 
damage to Wood enemies, and also do double damage to enemies on Grass
Panels. If a Wood enemy is on a Grass Panel, it will do 4x damage.

03. Aqua (Water)
ICON: 3 Water Droplets 
These chips go towards sacrifice for Aqua Soul (BM). They do double 
damage to Fire Enemies. 

04. Wood 
ICON: Leaf 
These chips go towards sacrifice for Wood Soul (BM). They do double 
damage to Electricity enemies. 

05. Electricity
ICON: Lightning Bolt
These chips are sacrificed for Thunder Soul (RS). They do double 
damage to Water enemies, and also double damage to enemies on Ice 
Panels. If a Water enemy is on an Ice Panel, it will 4x damage.

06. Wind 
ICON: Cloud/Gust of Wind
These chips are sacrificed for Wind Soul (RS). Chips like Wind and Fan
either push an enemy to the back row, or pull them to the front. Half
the chips in this type don’t do damage, but effect the enemy in some 
way.

07. Ground 
ICON: 3 Earthquake Lines 
These chips are used to sacrifice for Guts Soul (RS). Usually, these 
chips change the panel conditions on the field. They crack panels, 
turn them into holes, and in the case of Gutsman, damage panels as 
well. 

08. Recovery 
ICON: 2 Hearts
These chips are used to sacrifice for Roll Soul (RS). They do no 
damage to the enemy, but heal your HP to a certain amount. 

09. Invisibility
ICON: Purple Outlined Person
These chips are sacrificed for Search Soul (RS). These chips are used 
to conceal yourself from enemy attacks. 

10. Variable
ICON: +/- Icon. 
These chips are used to sacrifice for Number Soul (BM). These chips 
add power to your attacking chips. They always come in the * Code, 
with the exception of Numberman.

11. Break 
ICON: Grey Ball
These chips are used to sacrifice for Metal Soul (BM). These chips are 
usually basic damaging chips, with no real other effects provided.  

12. Sword 
ICON: Sword
These chips are sacrificed for Proto Soul (BM). These chips are high 
in damage, and is one of the best types out of the 15 (sadly). 

13. Obstacle
ICON: Block
These chips are used to sacrifice for Junk Soul (BM). Most of these 
chips usually don’t damage, and just stay on the field with their own
HP. Some of these chips can be even pushed with AirShot or WindSoul’s 
charged buster to do damage to an enemy equal to the obstacle’s max 
HP. 

14. Dark Chips
ICON: None
These chips don’t go towards the Chip Library. They appear randomly 
when you’re Emotion window is Worried or Dark Megaman. Be warned, as 
1 hit point will be PERMANENTLY deducted from your maximum HP when you
use a Dark Chip.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Each system described above (Number/Class system, Code system, Type 
system) have been compiled into 3 checklist. This makes for 
convenience when building a folder, and also provides easy viewing for
all chips.

Keyword: [FAQ--]

Here are questions asked by a lot of you via email/IM.

Q: What is this stupid Bank Program you keep on talking about LAMER!
A: The Bank Program is a gold colored program that appears in any one
of the 16 rooms in the Water God randomly. When you encounter him, he 
heals your health and gives you a random chip.

Q: CODES! ACTION REPLAY CODES, GAMESHARK, CODEBREAKER GIVE ME!
A: No, no, no. This is a Chip Guide, not a code center =/.

Q: Where’s Grab Revenge and AntiWood?
A: You can only get these two from PMDs if you got the items in those 
PMDs beforehand in Normal and Hard Mode. So, simply put, if you 
skipped out on those PMDs in the modes before Super Hard Redux, you 
can’t get the chips until your 4th play through. 

Q: Hey help me beat the game!
A: I’m here to only provide information on chips, that’s basically it.
I’m not a Walkthrough/FAQ, so don’t ask me about any in-game scenarios
or Boss Strategies.   

More to come obviously.

Providing locations of chips gained out of the traders, bank programs,
and the S-Rank information.

*Capcom of Japan and America: 
For making and bring this game stateside, even though it could have 
been MUCH better.

*MMBN4 Red Sun and Blue Moon GameFAQs Board Members: 
For providing round the clock information on Chips.

*The Other FAQ Writers of GameFAQs MMBN4 Sections: 
Inspiration guys. If it weren’t for you I probably would have never 
gotten the energy to do this at all. Keep on bringing great 
information to the players, it helps much more then you could imagine.

*Renowned Folders FAQ, NetBattle Strategy Guide, and the OFRC. All from
Megaman Battle Network 3 GameFAQs section.
All three of these things helped myself become an overall better 
player. The guides made me realize that this series has a nice layer of
strategy behind it through folder building.

*8/11/04- Version 2.6 Added Duo, GPP, and Final Gun info.

*8/1/04- Version 2.5: Fixed typos and grammer stuff in Intro section.

*7/30/04- Version 2.5: Deleted the unnecessary S-Rank thing. DarkMarth
already has a FAQ all about that. Added FAQ section. Fixed a couple of
typos.

*7/27/04- Version 2.31: Fixed up this Mega Chip Version Specific thing
I forgot to change. Thanks to geno for pointing it out.

*7/22/04- Version 2.3: FAQ Section, minor fixes.

*7/21/04- Version 2.0: Yeah, I’m calling this update Version 2.0. 
Simply because every single topic I wanted to cover in the guide is up 
(guess you could call it finished). This guide will just go through
minor polishing, such as changing typos, and cleaning up a few 
descriptions to make much more sense. Apart from that, another thing 
I’m trying to get is all possible information on Chips gained from 
Japanese E-Reader Cards. You’ll probably being seeing that information 
shortly. Remember, to prevent clutter on the Message Boards, always 
check everything in the FAQ first with Ctrl+F before asking questions 
there.

Now use this Guide until your eyes burn, because almost all you need 
to know about Battle Chips is right here.

*7/19/04- Version 1.6: Added more Standard Chip Locations.

*7/15/04- Version 1.5: I felt like this Guide didn’t give the full 
information possible on all the Battle Chips in the game (and plus 
emails on where certain chips are located just piled up in my inbox). 
So therefore I added a Chips Location section. Hope it helps. Also I 
fixed some more typos, and added Keywords.

*7/14/04- Version 1.0: First FAQ. Everything is up and ready for 
viewing.
